# Caesar Cipher Encryption in Python

This Python script implements a basic Caesar cipher encryption technique. The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

## Overview

The `caesar_cipher.py` script provides a command-line interface to encrypt messages using the Caesar cipher. It takes user input for the plaintext message and the shift value (encryption key), and then outputs the encrypted message.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-python.git
cd caesar-cipher-python
```

### 2. Run the Script

Navigate to the project directory and run the `caesar_cipher.py` script:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

### 3. Input Message and Shift Value

Follow the prompts to input the message you want to encrypt and the shift value (an integer) to apply to each character.

```plaintext
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello World
Enter the shift value (an integer): 3
```

### 4. View Encrypted Message

The script will display the encrypted message based on the input provided.

```plaintext
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog
```

## Example

Here's an example of encrypting the message "Hello World" with a shift of 3 using the script.
